= Introduction =

This sections contains a description of different campaign scenarios and user stories that should help to identify the requirements for IL2DCE.

== Campaign scenarios ==

=== Phony War ===

This campaign recreates the time between the outbreak of the war and before the Battle of France. During this time the Luftwaffe undertook reconnaissance and (armed) maritime reconnaissance missions.
The Fighter Command undertook patrol, convoy patrol missions and Bomber and Coastal Command undertook reconnaissance and (armed) maritime reconnaissance.

=== General ===

==== Client login ====

The player starts the game _IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_, selects _Multiplayer_ and then _Client_ in the menu, browses the server list and then connects to the server running IL2DCE. Once the mission has loaded he selects an army. He is informed over the current state and task of each active air group. He can then select one of the aircraft in the aircraft list.

==== Client logout ====

The player disconnects from the server running IL2DCE. His aircraft continues the mission under AI control.

==== Server start ====

The host starts the dedicated server application of _IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_ and either loads the initial campaign template to start a new campaign or any save-game of an existing campaign. The campaign progress continues as soon as the battle is started.

==== Server end ====

The host stops the battle and closes the dedicated server application. The current state is stored as a save-game.

=== Campaign types ===

==== Dynamic campaign ====

For a dynamic campaign only the initial strategic and tactical situation is defined for ground units, air units, supplies and reinforcements. The progress and outcome of the campaign is not defined and evolves completely dynamic depending on the past events.

This campaign type is recommended for fictional and semi-historical campaigns.

==== Semi-dynamic campaign ====

For a semi-dynamic campaign the strategic and tactical situation for ground units, air units, supplies and reinforcements is defined for various stages of the campaign. The interval between these stages may vary. Between two defined stages the progress of the campaign evolves dynamic. At the end of one stage the definitions of the following stage are applied, however certain information are propagated forward, like strength, supplies and experience of the units. To reduce the inflicted conflicts between the dynamic progress and the defined situation of the following stage the intervals between two stages should be small.

This campaign type is recommended for historical campaigns.

== Functional requirments ==

=== Air operations ===
The air operations are simulated at the tactical level of war. The elementary unit is the squadron. A squadron is given a mission.

==== Fighter: Intercept mission ====

==== Fighter: Patrol mission ====

==== Fighter: Escort mission ====

==== Bomber: Airfield attack mission ====

==== Bomber: Radar attack mission ====

== Non-functional Requirments ==

=== Campaign Creation ===
New campaigns can be created with little effort. A campaign template file is created within the _Full Mission Builder_ that defines the initial situation of the campaign. Configuration files can be provided optionally to overwrite the global configuration.

=== Rapid release cycles ===
New versions are released frequently.

=== Scalability ===

==== Performance ====
Only the units that are involved in an operation are visible in the 3D engine. The amount of operations in each battle can be scaled to the available hardware.

==== Content ====
New game content (Aircraft, vehicles, statics, and maps) can be added without changes in the source code.
