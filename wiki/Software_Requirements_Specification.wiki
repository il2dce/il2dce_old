= Introduction =

This document contains the vision, examples for different campaign scenarios and user stories that should help to identify the requirements for IL2DCE.

= Details =

== Vision ==

The vision of IL2DCE is to provide a dynamic campaign engine for IL-2 _Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_. IL2DCE simulates a persistent world where the actions of the participating player and AI actors have a permanent effect and influence the outcome of a campaign.

== Examples for campaign scenarios ==

=== Adlerangriff (13th August - 6th September 1940) ===

The bombers of the Luftwaffe attack airfields and radar stations, fighters provide escort.

Fighter Command undertakes intercept and patrol operations.

== User stories ==

=== General ===

==== Client login ====

The player starts the game _IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_, selects _Multiplayer_ and then _Client_ in the menu, browses the server list and then connects to the server running IL2DCE. Once the mission has loaded he selects an army. He is informed over the current state and task of each active air group. He can then select one of the aircraft in the aircraft list.

==== Client logout ====

The player disconnects from the server running IL2DCE. His aircraft continues the mission under AI control.

==== Server start ====

The host starts the dedicated server application of _IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_ and either loads the initial campaign template to start a new campaign or any save-game of an existing campaign. The campaign progress continues as soon as the battle is started.

==== Server end ====

The host stops the battle and closes the dedicated server application. The current state is stored as a save-game.

=== Campaign types ===

==== Dynamic campaign ====

For a dynamic campaign only the initial strategic and tactical situation is defined for ground units, air units, supplies and reinforcements. The progress and outcome of the campaign is not defined and evolves completely dynamic depending on the past events.

This campaign type is recommended for fictional and semi-historical campaigns.

==== Semi-dynamic campaign ====

For a semi-dynamic campaign the strategic and tactical situation for ground units, air units, supplies and reinforcements is defined for various stages of the campaign. The interval between these stages may vary. Between two defined stages the progress of the campaign evolves dynamic. At the end of one stage the definitions of the following stage are applied, however certain information are propagated forward, like strength, supplies and experience of the units. To reduce the inflicted conflicts between the dynamic progress and the defined situation of the following stage the intervals between two stages should be small.

This campaign type is recommended for historical campaigns.

=== Persistent world ===

== Non-functional Requirments ==

=== Campaign Creation ===
New campaigns can be created with little effort. A campaign template file is created within the _Full Mission Builder_ that defines the initial situation of the campaign. Configuration files can be provided optionally to overwrite the global configuration.

=== Rapid release cycles ===
New versions are released frequently.

=== Scalability ===

==== Performance ====
Only the units that are involved in an operation are visible in the 3D engine. The amount of operations in each battle can be scaled to the available hardware.

==== Content ====
New game content (Aircraft, vehicles, statics, and maps) can be added without changes in the source code.
