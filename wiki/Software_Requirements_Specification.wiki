= Introduction =

This document specifies the vision and the requirements of IL2DCE. The introduction contains the vision statement and examples for possible campaigns. The details contain the functional requirements in form of use cases and the non-functional requirements.

== Vision ==

The vision of IL2DCE is to provide a dynamic campaign engine for IL-2 _Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_. The core feature of IL2DCE is a persistent world where the actions of the participating human and AI actors have a permanent effect and influence the outcome of a campaign. It has a cooperative gameplay that concentrates on aircraft groups, contrary to a dogfight gameplay that concentrates on individual aircraft. It has a single-player and multiplayer mode. The target audience are individual players in single-player, one or more virtual squadrons in closed cooperative campaigns, several virtual squadrons in a closed competitive campaign and individual players and several virtual squadrons in a open campaign.

== Examples for campaigns ==

=== Adlerangriff (13 August - 6 September 1940) ===

The Luftwaffe tries to crush Fighter Command. Their bombers attack the airfields and radar stations, while their fighters provide escort. Fighter Command undertakes intercept and patrol operations.

The main goal for both sides is to reduce the amount of aircraft of the opposing side.

=== Host world ===

Actor: Server admin

Steps:

 # Open server: The actor launches the server application.
 # Load mission: The actor selects and loads the mission, either a initial campaign template to start a new campaign or a save-game to continue an existing campaign.
 # Start battle: The campaign progress continues as soon as the battle is started.
 # Stop battle: The campaign progress is stopped and a save-game is created.
 # Close server: The server application is closed. 

=== Attend mission ===

Actor: Multiplayer pilot, single-player pilot, squadron commander

Steps:

 # Login server: The actor launches the client application
 # Connect server: The actor connects to the server running IL2DCE.
 # Select army: Once connected the actor selects his army. 
 # Get aircraft information: The actor can get information over the current state and task for each of the available aircrafts. 
 # Select aircraft: He can then select one of the aircraft available aircraft. 
 # Read briefing: The actor can read the briefing that contains the mission goal, mission parameter and flight plan.
 # Fly mission: The actor flies the mission as the pilot of the selected aircraft.
 # Read debriefing: After the actor has finished the mission he can read the debriefing containing the mission result, achievements and statistics. 
 # Logout server: The actor disconnects from the server.

Variations:
 * If the actor disconnects before the mission is finished his aircraft will continue under AI control.
 * After selecting a aircraft the actor may switch to a different aircraft. 

=== Issue order ===

Actor: Commander-in-chief

Steps:
 # ...

Variations:

 * New air mission: A new mission for a random air group is started periodically. The mission type depends on the capabilities of the air group's aircraft. The air group must remain idle for a certain time to allow players to select an aircraft, read the briefing and prepare for the flight. Some mission types are escorted, they trigger a escort mission for another random air group.

=== Create campaign ===

Actor: Campaign author

Steps:
 # Define front line
 # Define points of interest
 # Define initial position of air and ground units
 # Optionally adjust configuration files

Variations:
 * Define front line and position of air and ground units for certain dates

=== Update world ===

Actor: AMission, Simulator

Steps:

Variations:

== Non-functional requirments ==

=== Radar, Acoustics detectors, Observer Corps ===

=== Air mission types ===

==== Ground attack mission ====

An air group on a ground attack mission flies to the target area and attack the target. If a escort air group is available, they meet a rendezvous point with the escort directly after the take-off. The rendezvous point is located between the take-off airfields of the participating air groups. 

==== Escort mission ====

An air group on a escort mission meets with the escorted air group at a rendezvous point. The accompany the other air group until it has returned close to the landing airfield and then they return to their own landing airfield.

==== Intercept mission ====

An air group on an intercept mission attacks an incoming opposing air group. The air group tries to meet the opposing air group as early as possible. After the meetup the air group returns to the landing airfield.

==== Defensive patrol mission ====

An air group on a defensive patrol protects an area or route over own territory against incoming opposing air groups. After a specific time it returns to the landing airfield.

=== Campaign types ===

==== Dynamic campaign ====

For a dynamic campaign only the initial strategic and tactical situation is defined for ground units, air units, supplies and reinforcements. The progress and outcome of the campaign is not defined and evolves completely dynamic depending on the past events.

This campaign type is recommended for fictional and semi-historical campaigns.

==== Semi-dynamic campaign ====

For a semi-dynamic campaign the strategic and tactical situation for ground units, air units, supplies and reinforcements is defined for various stages of the campaign. The interval between these stages may vary. Between two defined stages the progress of the campaign evolves dynamic. At the end of one stage the definitions of the following stage are applied, however certain information are propagated forward, like strength, supplies and experience of the units. To reduce the inflicted conflicts between the dynamic progress and the defined situation of the following stage the intervals between two stages should be small.

This campaign type is recommended for historical campaigns.

=== Persistent world ===

Create savegame, Load savegame, Load template, Aircraft loss, ...

=== Campaign creation ===

New campaigns can be created with little effort. A campaign template file is created within the _Full Mission Builder_ that defines the initial situation of the campaign. Configuration files can be provided optionally to overwrite the global configuration.

=== Rapid release cycles ===

New versions are released frequently.

=== Scalability ===

==== Performance ====

Only the units that are involved in an operation are visible in the 3D engine. The amount of operations in each battle can be scaled to the available hardware.

==== Game content ====

New game content (e.g. Aircraft, vehicles, statics, maps, ...) can be added without changes in the source code.
