=== Game Modes ===

==== Single-player ====
A single-player mode is provided where the player selects his unit at the beginning of the campaign. Every battle of the campaign contains at least a operation with a primary mission for the player's unit and optionally additional operations depending on the configuration. The battle ends when the primary mission of the player's unit is completed.

==== Multiplayer ====
A multiplayer mode is provided where remote players connect to the server that is running IL2DCE.

===== Cooperative =====
Same as single-player mode but allows remote players to select the army, the air group and the aircraft.

===== Dogfight =====
The battle that is lasting over several operations.

== Non-functional Requirments ==

=== Campaign Creation ===
New campaigns can be created with little effort. A campaign template file is created within the _Full Mission Builder_ that defines the initial situation of he campaign. Configuration files can be provided optionally to overwrite the global configuration.

=== Rapid release cycles ===
New versions are released frequently.

=== Scalability ===

==== Performance ====
Only the units that are involved in an operation are visible in the 3D engine. The amount of operations in each battle can be scaled to the available hardware.

==== Content ====
New game content (Aircraft, vehicles, statics, and maps) can be added with little effort.
