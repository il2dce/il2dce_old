= Introduction =

This sections contains a description of different campaign scenarios and use cases that should help to identify the requirements for IL2DCE.

== Campaign scenarios ==

=== Phony War ===
This campaign recreates the time between the outbreak of the war and before the Battle of France. During this time the Luftwaffe undertook reconnaissance and (armed) maritime reconnaissance missions.
The Fighter Command undertook patrol, convoy patrol missions and Bomber and Coastal Command undertook reconnaissance and (armed) maritime reconnaissance.

=== Campaign types ===

==== Dynamic campaign ====

For a dynamic campaign only the initial strategic and tactical situation is defined for ground units, air units, supplies and reinforcements. The progress and outcome of the campaign is not defined and evolves completely dynamic depending on the past events.

This campaign type is recommended for fictional and semi-historical campaigns.

==== Semi-dynamic campaign ====

For a semi-dynamic campaign the strategic and tactical situation for ground units, air units, supplies and reinforcements is defined for various stages of the campaign. The interval between these stages may vary. Between two defined stages the progress of the campaign evolves dynamic. At the end of one stage the definitions of the following stage are applied, however certain information are propagated forward, like strength, supplies and experience of the units. To reduce the inflicted conflicts between the dynamic progress and the defined situation of the following stage the intervals between two stages should be small.

This campaign type is recommended for historical campaigns.

=== Air operations ===
The air operations are simulated at the tactical level of war. The elementary unit is the squadron. A squadron is given a mission.

==== Mission types ====
   * LIASON

   * RECON
   * MARITIME_RECON
   * ARMED_RECON
   * ARMED_MARITIME_RECON

   * ATTACK_SHIP

   * INTERCEPT
   * NIGHT_INTERCEPT
   * ESCORT

=== Ground operations ===

==== Offensive operations (Armor) ====

==== Defensive operations (Artillery) ====

==== Support operations (Vehicle) ====

==== Ship operations (Ship) ====


=== Squadron managment ===

==== Medals and decoration ===
Medals and decorations are commissioned for certain achievments.

==== Rank ====
The rank reflects the experience of the pilot.

==== Pilot experience ====
The experience of a pilot is reflected by his position within the squadron. 
   * Wingman
   * Section Leader
   * Flight Leader
   * Commanding Officer

==== Commanding Officer ====
The pilot can become the commanding officer of a squadron and can then influence the mission parameters. 
   * Select aircraft that take part in the mission
   * Select the loadout for the mission
   * Select the pilots that take part in the mission
   * Modify waypoints to a certain degree

=== Game Modes ===

==== Single-player ====
A single-player mode is provided where the player selects his unit at the beginning of the campaign. Every battle of the campaign contains at least a operation with a primary mission for the player's unit and optionally additional operations depending on the configuration. The battle ends when the primary mission of the player's unit is completed.

==== Multiplayer ====
A multiplayer mode is provided where remote players connect to the server that is running IL2DCE.

===== Cooperative =====
Same as single-player mode but allows remote players to select the army, the air group and the aircraft.

===== Dogfight =====
The battle that is lasting over several operations.

== Non-functional Requirments ==

=== Campaign Creation ===
New campaigns can be created with little effort. A campaign template file is created within the _Full Mission Builder_ that defines the initial situation of the campaign. Configuration files can be provided optionally to overwrite the global configuration.

=== Rapid release cycles ===
New versions are released frequently.

=== Scalability ===

==== Performance ====
Only the units that are involved in an operation are visible in the 3D engine. The amount of operations in each battle can be scaled to the available hardware.

==== Content ====
New game content (Aircraft, vehicles, statics, and maps) can be added with little effort.
