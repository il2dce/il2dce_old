=== IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover ===

IL2DCE is an AddIn that integrates into _IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_. It has dependencies to the following assemblies of _IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_:
  * core.dll
  * gamePages.dll
  * gamePlay.dll
  * gameWorld.dll

They are located at "$home\parts\core". For the default installation this is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\il-2 sturmovik cliffs of dover\parts\core". The projects of the IL2DCE solution are configured to use a relative path to these assemblies. Therefore the source has to be placed at a specific location relative to the $home folder. See [CompileInstructions#Checkout Checkout] for more details.


=== SubWCRev.exe ===

IL2DCE uses the highest SVN revision number as part of the assembly version number. To retrieve it from the SVN repository and make it available as a variable the SubWCRev.exe is used. This Windows console application is part of a TortoiseSVN installation. Make sure that the environment variable "path" contains the binary folder (e.g. "C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin") of TortoiseSVN.
