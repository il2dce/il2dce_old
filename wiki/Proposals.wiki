*Dan Antonescu*

- *TERROR mission type* (bombing cities/civil targets)

- *delayed take off/spawning for escort/intercept missions*:
     + player is escort/intercept fighter: place the bombers on a calculated reach-point in their flight-path in which they are in range/detected and at the moment player's escort/intercept airplanes are spawned. this must also take account of bombers' already consumed fuel

     + player is bomber: delayed spawn (and take-off) for the AI escort/intercept planes (spawn them only when the bombers are in range/detected)

- *AI ground control* / central command / master mind which should do all needed actions in real time (while the mission is going on):
     + generate recon/weather recon; CAPs; attacks + escorts; interceptions

     + deal with newly appeared/reported situations

     + allow special players (admins/commanders) send commands to AI ground control)

- *player commands*:
     + online wars commander(s) player(s) / high rank single player:  create ground/see/air groups and assign them missions (to intercept incoming flights, to attack certain targets, to patrol certain areas, to escort certain flights)

     + report enemy sightings (for recon missions): quadrant, group type, size, composition, heading, altitude, speed

     + report bogey sightings and eventually change flight's current waypoint to investigate the newly sighted bogeys (force AI)

     + ask for help to (AI) ground control / central command (which should spawn more flights to deal with the wrongly asserted situation)

- *customized radar/ground control* (radars which are not 100% right (altitude, number of planes, directions, etc)

- *dynamic mission objectives* (take-off objectives which may be changed at some point(s) during the mission)

- *dynamic kill confirmation* (with chances of success depending if above friendly territory, if in certain distance from friendly aircrafts, friendly ground, etc)

- *historical aces pilots* (have historical aces populate their historical squadrons at historical dates/periods)

- *a points system* (based on player's deeds during the flight:
     + number of killed/damaged enemy airplanes/groundunits/bombing objectives (radars, ships, ammo depots, etc)

     + number of lost friendly escorted planes, protection/loss of own Rottenführer/Katschmarek (or other Schwarm partners if Schwarmführer)

     + keeping a maximum distance from own Rottenführer when flying as Katschmarek (and being warned/penalized when exceeding it)

- *kill tracks and characteristics advancement for all pilots* (RPG system) plus *rank promotions and rewards*

- *limited airplanes supply system* (continuous loses might not be replaced -> smaller aircraft numbers flights, older aircraft types reactivated)

- *new airplane types gradual infusion* (new aircraft types entering service at certain dates might be in small number, replacing only part of a squadron's flights)

- *manual player request for transfer* to another Geschwader

- *AI forcing* (nearby bogey detection (based on pilots visual skill), dynamic attack waypoint addition (forcing AI to intercept, identify and attack bogey groups)

- *RRR system* (repair/rearm/resupply) (if the player lands and taxies to certain locations/areas (close to a fuel cistern for example parked somewhere) on airfields, the script will move the player into a newly spawned aircraft and destroy the old landed one) - specially for online battles

- *dynamic weather generator* (at this moment, it might be possible to change weather conditions IF the new weather conditions from a newly loaded missions during the current one are overwriting/replacing the initial missions's weather characteristics)
