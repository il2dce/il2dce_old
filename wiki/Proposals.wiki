*Dan Antonescu*

- delayed take off/spawning for escort/intercept missions (only when the escorted airplanes reach a certain point - are in range/are detected and in range)

- in-flight spawning for escorted/intercepted missions (place them on their calculated reach point in their flight-path at the moment player's escort airplanes are spawned)

- dynamic mission objectives (take-off objectives which may be changed at some point(s) during the mission)

- dynamic kill confirmation (with chances of success depending if above friendly territory, if in certain distance from friendly aircrafts, friendly ground, etc)

- pilot aces

- a points system (based on player's deeds during the flight:
     + number of killed/damaged enemy airplanes/groundunits/bombing objectives (radars, ships, ammo depots, etc)

     + number of lost friendly escorted planes, protection/loss of own Rottenführer/Katschmarek (or other Schwarm partners if Schwarmführer)

     + keeping a maximum distance from own Rottenführer when flying as Katschmarek (and being warned/penalized when exceeding it)

- kill tracks and characteristics advancement for all pilots (RPG system) plus rank promotions and rewards

- limited airplanes supply system (continuous loses might not be replaced -> smaller aircraft numbers flights, older aircraft types reactivated)

- new airplane types gradual infusion (new aircraft types entering service at certain dates might be in small number, replacing only part of a squadron's flights)

- manual player request for transfer to another Geschwader

- AI forcing (nearby bogey detection (based on pilots visual skill), dynamic attack waypoint addition (forcing AI to intercept, identify and attack bogey groups)

- RRR system (repair/rearm/resupply) (if the player lands and taxies to certain locations/areas (close to a fuel cistern for example parked somewhere) on airfields, the script will move the player into a newly spawned aircraft and destroy the old landed one) - specially for online battles
