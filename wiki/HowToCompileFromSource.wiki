=== IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover ===

IL2DCE is an AddIn that integrates into _IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_. It has dependencies to the following assemblies of _IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_:

 * core.dll
 * gamePages.dll
 * gamePlay.dll
 * gameWorld.dll

They are located at "$home\parts\core". For the default installation this is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\il-2 sturmovik cliffs of dover\parts\core". The projects of the IL2DCE solution are configured to use a relative path to these assemblies. Therefore the source has to be placed at a specific location relative to the $home folder. See [HowToCompileFromSource#Checkout Checkout] for more details.
