=== `IPersistentWorld` ===

The `IPersistentWorld` represents the current campaign state. The state contains different types of group (e.g. `AirGroup`, `GroundGroup`, `NavalGroup`, `SupplyGroup` and `ReinforcementGroup`). The `IPersistentWorld` also contains a list of `IHeadquarters`. Any change of the campaign state has to be propagated to the contained `IHeadquarters`, which then can interact with the `IPersistentWorld` to react on the change. 

The `IPersistentWorld` provides a interface to send a `ICommand` to the contained groups. The `ICommand` will then be executed by the group in the persistent world.

There are two different implementations for the `IPersistentWorld`. The `Mission` represents the real-time progress the campaign. The real-time progress is provided by the engine of _IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_. The `Mission` listens to the events that are fired by the _IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_ and applies them on the campaign state. To execute a `ICommand` it will be translated into calls to the engine.

The `Simulator` represents the time-compressed progress of the campaign that is used to skip time spans that should not progress in real-time. The time-compressed progress is not provided by the engine of _IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover_. Hence a simplified simulation the `ICommand` calls must be used to change the campaign state.
